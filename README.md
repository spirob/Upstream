# Upstream
The purpose of this project was to learn swift as well as the xcode interface. As a result, there is no documentation and poor coding conventions. This project was compeleted within a week with no prior knowledge of swift or xcode. 

HOW TO PLAY: 
Lean left and right with your IOS device to dodge aligators and pickup coins. The more coins you get, the higher your score will be! As time goes on, the speed and number of coins and aligators will vary to make the game more difficult!

BUGS:
The pause button is currently only partially implemented. The items on screen will continue to move as well as the player icon, although new items will not spawn.
